## Swift to Laravel REST Api
This is a plain, authenticated Swift3 Crud application connecting to a Laravel Rest Api on the back. It was a simple Jobs listview with a form page for deleting, adding and editing. The application is token authenticated. The token is given to the Swift application by the Laravel server after successful registration or login. 

## Prerequisite
Clone or Download this repo. These instructions assume that you have installed Composer, Laravel 5.5, PHP7, Node Package Manager and whatever prefered database system. I used Mysql for this.
